# FOOD_VISION-USING-CNN

The images we're going to work with are from the Food-101 dataset, a collection of 101 different categories of 101,000 (1000 images per category) real-world images of food dishes.
I only used two of the categories, pizza 🍕 and steak 🥩 and build a binary classifier.
This model Classifies whether a picture of food contains pizza 🍕 or steak 🥩
Accuracy of this model is 87.6%
